After some reseach I found that python had a library called 'heapq'. So, I used a binary tree which was 
populated using the two smallest tuples (frequencies of each letter) that were in the heap.

Time Complexity: 
    O(n log n) because we are building the tree.
Space Complexity:
    O(m^n) because of the recursion in assign_bits()
